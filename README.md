Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

### Contributing Guidelines

For non-Microsoft employees, you can fork this repository, and then submit any contributions with a pull request.  Someone on the contributors team will review your pull request and then work to get it merged into the repository.  Details on how to fork this repository and submit a pull request are available on GitHub's documentation page below,

[Creating a Pull Request from a Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### Spell Check
We also have spell checking enabled via a GitHub Action.  To see if you have any spelling typos, run the Spellcheck Action associate with this repository.  We also have a file that contains a list of spell check exceptions.  You may need to add acronyms or other words to this list as you run into them.

[Spell Check Word List](./config/wordlist.txt)

### Folder Naming Conventions
If you want to add a new demo or whitepaper, follow the folder structure convention below,

```
demos/
├─ your-new-demo-folder/
│  ├─ files/
│  │  ├─ image1.PNG
│  │  ├─ image2.PNG
│  │  ├─ sampleSolution.zip
│  ├─ README.md
whitepapers/
├─ your-new-whitepaper-folder/
│  ├─ files/
│  │  ├─ image1.PNG
│  ├─ README.md
├─ your-new-whitepaper2-folder/
│  ├─ summary.pdf
README.md
```

You can decide if you would rather have a ```README.md``` file with Markdown syntax, or if you prefer, you can convert a document into a PDF file and then upload that into the subfolder for the demo/whitepaper.  PDF's will render in the browser when viewed on GitHub. ```README.md``` files are preferred as they will also support version control and change history on the actual file.

Lastly, link from this main ```README.md``` page to your new demo/whitepaper and the corresponding ```README.md``` or PDF file.
