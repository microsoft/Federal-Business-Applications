# TIC for Internal Agency Use

For internal Agency use of Power Platform and D365, our services leverage the security and auditing capabilities of Microsoft 365.  We have a great blog series that outlines how Microsoft 365 services align to TIC.  The blog links can be found below,

# TIC for Public Facing Power Pages (i.e. Portals)

We recommend using Azure Front Door with Power Pages to support CISA TIC requirements.  Some of the benefits you get when using Azure Front Door with Power Pages are below,

* Support ````IPv6```` traffic
* Built in Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Content Delivery Network (CDN) of static content in Power Pages
* Restrict Power Pages traffic to only coming through Azure Front Door

Below is a great resource on designing a web application to use Azure Front Door to meet TIC 3.0 requirements,

[TIC 3.0 Azure Front Door Architecture](https://github.com/haithamshahin333/Federal-App-Innovation-Community/tree/main/topics/infrastructure/solutions/tic3.0/Azure-Front-Door)

You can easily swap out the web application above with a Power Pages web application.  That design would look like this,

Below we have great documentation on how to configure a Power Pages Portal with Azure Front Door,

[Set up Azure Front Door with portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/portals/azure-front-door)

Lastly, you can also configure diagnostic logs from Power Pages to get sent to an Azure Storage account.
