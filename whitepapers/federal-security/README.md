### How does data travel from Office365 GCC to Power Platform GCC?  
Microsoft maintains a **private**, global network infrastructure that seamlessly interconnects all of our data centers. This dedicated network ensures that **communications between Azure Government and Azure Commercial services occur over Microsoft's secure, high-speed fiber network, rather than the public internet**. Our intelligent networking stack ensures that data travels efficiently within our ecosystem, providing reliable and secure connectivity for all services.

## Azure Active Directory Conditional Access
The sovereign cloud specific AAD applications for conditional access are below,

### GCC AAD Application Details
| Service | AAD Application Name | AAD Application ID |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Power Apps | ```` Microsoft PowerApps ```` | ```` 475226c6-020e-4fb2-8a90-7a972cbfc1d4 ```` |
| Power Automate | ```` Microsoft Flow ```` | ```` 7df0a125-d3be-4c96-aa54-591f83ff541c ```` |
| Dataverse / Dynamics 365 | ```` Common Data Service ```` | ```` 00000007-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 ```` |
| Power BI | ```` Microsoft Power BI Government Cloud ```` | ```` fc4979e5-0aa5-429f-b13a-5d1365be5566 ```` |

### GCC High AAD Application Details
| Service | AAD Application Name | AAD Application ID |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Power Apps | ```` PowerApps Service GCC L4 ```` | ```` 5e0cb1f6-2841-4956-9c76-868bfbc15a39 ```` |
| Power Automate | ```` Microsoft Flow Portal GCC High ```` | ```` 9856e8dd-37b6-4749-a54b-8f6503ea93b7 ```` |
| Dataverse / Dynamics 365 | ```` Common Data Service ```` | ```` 00000007-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 ```` |


> At this time (10/28/2022) there is a known issue that the Power Automate service does not show up in Azure for Government's Conditional Access portal.  The work around to use conditional access in GCC High is to create a policy that is enforced for all cloud applications, versus selecting Power Automate individually.  

# TIC 3.0 for Public Facing Power Pages (i.e. Portals)

We recommend using Azure Application Gateway with Power Pages to support CISA TIC requirements.  Some of the benefits you get when using Azure Application Gateway with Power Pages are below,

* Built in Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Content Delivery Network (CDN) of static content in Power Pages
* Restrict Power Pages traffic to a single IP address from Azure Application Gateway

Below is a great resource on designing a general web application to use Azure Front Door / Azure Application Gateway to meet TIC 3.0 requirements,

* [TIC 3.0 Azure Web Application Architecture](https://github.com/haithamshahin333/Federal-App-Innovation-Community/tree/main/topics/infrastructure/solutions/tic3.0/Azure-Front-Door)

You can easily swap out the web application above with a Power Pages web application.  That design would look like this,

![Power Pages & Azure Application Gateway Diagram](images/PowerPagesAppGatewayDiagram.png)

Below we have great documentation on how to configure a Power Pages Portal with Azure Front Door.  While today we recommend Azure Application Gateway, the documentation for Azure Front Door below can also be applied with an Azure Application Gateway instance.  

> Today Power Pages does not support Azure Front Door ID filtering. Once Power Pages supports Azure Front Door ID filtering (i.e. ````X-Azure-FDID```` header values) we will update this guidance to use Azure Front Door instead.

* [Set up Azure Front Door with portals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/portals/azure-front-door)

# Power Pages Diagnostic Logging

You can also configure diagnostic logs from Power Pages to get sent to an Azure Storage account.

![Configure Diagnostic Logging with Power Pages](images/EnableDiagnosticLogs.png)

# Power Pages (i.e. Portals) Security Settings
When designing a Power Page, we highly recommend reviewing the security controls for any public facing website.  Those details can be found in our public documentation below,

* [Power Pages Security Controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/security/power-pages-security)

# Power Platform / Dynamics 365 Endpoint URLs
Use the following public documentation page to get the full list of internet URLs to allow for Power Platform and Dynamics 365 cloud services.  Make sure to filter to your US Government cloud region (i.e. GCC, GCC High or DOD).

* [Power Platform Government Endpoint URLs for Allow List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/online-requirements#internet-urls-to-allow)
* [Dynamics 365 Government Endpoint URLs for Allow List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/microsoft-dynamics-365-government#dynamics-365-us-government-urls)

# Power Platform / Dynamics 365 IP Ranges
Use the following Azure for Government service tags to get the IP ranges that Power Platform / Dynamics 365 use for GCC, GCC High and DOD cloud regions.  You can find the full list of Azure for Government IP Ranges in the following document,

* [Azure for Government IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57063)

## GCC and GCC High IP Ranges
* ````AzureCloud.usgovvirginia````
* ````AzureCloud.usgovtexas````

## DOD IP Ranges
* ````AzureCloud.usdodcentral````
* ````AzureCloud.usdodeast````

# Microsoft 365 Message Center
We also recommend that you set up monitoring for the Microsoft 365 Message Center to get notified to updates and changes that we announce ahead of time that could impact network and firewall policies you have configured.  Details of the Microsoft 365 Message Center can be found on the public documentation page below,

[Microsoft 365 Message Center Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center?view=o365-worldwide)

For Microsoft Business Applications, we recommend monitoring the following services,

* Dynamics 365 Apps
* Finance and Operations Apps
* Microsoft Dataverse
* Microsoft Power Automate
* Microsoft Power Automate in Microsoft 365
* Power Apps
* Power Apps in Microsoft 365
* Power BI
* Power Platform

# Data Gateway Configuration
Power Platform's data gateway enables you to combine on premise data with your data in the cloud.  More details on the data gateway can be found in our public docs below,

* [On-premises data gateways documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/)

Power Platform data gateway leverages the Azure Service Bus Relay service to communicate from the cloud to your on premise infrastructure.  In GCC, GCC High and DOD there is a managed Azure Service Bus Relay namespace that lives in Azure for Government.  Below is an example of how this is laid out in GCC,

![GCC Default Data Gateway Setup](images/PowerPlatformGCC_ManagedServiceBus.png)

If you want to have more control of the networking policies for the Azure Service Bus Relay instance, you can create your own in an Azure for Government subscription.

![GCC Default Data Gateway Setup](images/PowerPlatformGCC_CustomerCreatedServiceBus.png)

You can then configure your Power Platform data gateway instance to leverage your Azure Service Bus Relay instance in the steps below,

* [Configure a Custom Azure Service Bus Relay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-azure-relay)

Also, if you are using Azure for Government ExpressRoute and you want the Power Platform data gateway to use ExpressRoute, you need to make sure you include the following Azure service tags into your ExpressRoute configuration,

## Data Gateway Ports
For a full list of the Data Gateway ports and fully qualified domain names (FQDN) that are required to run Data Gateway, please see our public documentation page below.  Be sure to reference the table for GCC, GCC High or DOD for your actual environments configuration details.

* [Power Platform Data Gateway Ports & FQDN Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-communication#ports)

## GCC and GCC High Service Tags

* ````ServiceBus.USGovTexas````
* ````ServiceBus.USGovVirginia````

## DOD Service Tags

* ````ServiceBus.USDoDCentral````
* ````ServiceBus.USDoDEast````

You can find the full list of Azure for Government IP Ranges in the following document,

* [Azure for Government IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57063)
